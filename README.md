# Introduction

This package contains a dashboard to view the glue tests. It itself is written in glue and can run on the [standalone glue webserver](https://github.com/nablex/glue-http-server).

# Mobile

The dashboard is designed to be fully responsive.

# Offline accessibility

All data is already stored in local storage and almost everything is available for offline access to the resources as well but this still needs some final tweaking to work properly. Until such time, it is disabled.
